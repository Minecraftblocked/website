Minecraftblocked is an ongoing project dedicated to providing transparency in the Minecraft gaming community. The website is built using Next.js and Typescript, and serves as the front-end to present data in the database. It offers Minecraft players insights into servers that have been flagged or blocked by Mojang.

## Features

- Server Status: Provides the current status of each server, including whether it is blocked by Mojang.
- Search and Filter: Allows users to search for specific servers and filter results based on different criteria.
- Responsive Design: The website is designed to be responsive and works across various devices.

## Tech Stack

- Next.js: We chose Next.js for its powerful features including server-side rendering which helps in faster page loads and an enhanced user experience.
- TypeScript: TypeScript is used to ensure type safety, resulting in more reliable and maintainable code.
- Prisma: For our database layer, we are using Prisma with a MySQL database to manage records of Minecraft servers. This allows for strong typing and high performance.
